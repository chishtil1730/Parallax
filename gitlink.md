# Git Link 

Whenever we use git in our local machines, we also have to cross verify that the changes reflect in remote too.
We can eliminate this by integrating a CLI tool, that will help you with verification and also smoothen out the user experience.

### Performance
| S.no | Task  |
|------|-------|
| 1    |Visual Command Feedback: Replaces blank terminal responses with color-coded summaries and progress bars when running commands like git add .|
| 2    |Side-by-Side Diff Viewer: A dual-pane TUI that shows "Before" and "After" code changes horizontally, featuring syntax highlighting and intra-line change detection.|
| 3    |Remote Verification: Automatically checks the GitHub API to confirm when a push has successfully reached the server without needing a browser.|
| 4    |Integrated PR Comments: Displays GitHub Pull Request discussions and "sticky note" feedback directly under the relevant lines of code in your terminal.|
| 5    |Pre-Push Safety Guard: A "traffic light" system that warns you if your local branch is behind the remote, has a merge conflict, or is failing CI/CD tests.|
| 6    |IDE-Agile: Operates as a standalone binary (likely Go or Rust) that works consistently across any terminal or integrated IDE environment.|
